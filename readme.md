ColorLake runs in your web browser, so ensure you have:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- An internet connection for initial asset loading

## 🛠 Features

ColorLake offers the following features:

- **Batch Upload**: Upload multiple images at once. ColorLake generates thumbnails for easy selection.
- **LUT Preview Matrix**: View several LUTs side by side and switch pages effortlessly.
- **Real-time Comparison**: Use a slider to see before and after effects between your original image and the applied LUT.

## 🏗 Technical Overview

ColorLake utilizes advanced technology:

- Built using Vite, React, and TypeScript for a responsive experience.
- Uses WebGL fragment shaders to apply LUTs in real-time within your browser.
- All LUT files can be stored in the `public/LUTS` folder, making it easy to manage your presets.

## 📂 Application Structure

Understanding the app's structure will help you customize it:

- `src/`: Contains React components, WebGL Renderer, and LUT parsing tools.
- `public/LUTS/`: Holds your `.cube` LUT files. You can add your own as long as you keep the folder name.
- `dist/`: Static resources generated by running `npm run build`. You can deploy these to any static site.

## 🌟 Local Running Instructions

If you want to run ColorLake on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

The development server will start and listen on `http://localhost:5173`. Simply open this link in your browser to use ColorLake.

## 📦 Production Build

To create a production-ready version, perform these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory if you aren't already.
3. Run these commands:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

`npm run build` creates optimized static files, while `npm run preview` allows you to locally check the production version.

## 🎨 Custom LUT Files

Adding your LUTs is easy:

1. Place your new `.cube` files in the `public/LUTS` folder. You can use file names that include spaces.

## 💡 Tips for a Smooth Experience

- **Image Resizing**: During the upload process, ColorLake automatically resizes images to avoid memory issues. Images will be adjusted to a maximum edge length of 2048px and total pixel count under 4 million.
- **Hardware Support Validation**: If your hardware cannot support the required texture sizes, ColorLake will adjust the dimensions automatically to ensure a seamless experience.
- **Slider Control**: In comparison mode, the slider allows fine control using mouse, touch, or keyboard arrows.
